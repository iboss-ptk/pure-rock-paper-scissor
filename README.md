# pure-rock-paper-scissor
rock-paper-scissor game with bot implemented in purescript

## How to setup

Setting up development environment by running the following command:
```
$ npm install -g purescript pulp bower
```

And at project root, we can run `yarn` to install dependencies.
Run `yarn test` for running tests and `yarn test:watch` for watching file change
and run tests.

Run `yarn start` for development server.

# Testing
Most of the test cases in this project use property-based testing to
generate bunch of test cases instead of specifying one by one.
